# Sonal Harsh

**DevOps Engineer | Embedded Systems Innovator | Humane Tech Entrepreneur**

Welcome to my personal site. I'm the founder of [Pavafetch](https://pavafetch.com), where I developed the LostPet Beacon â€” a patent-pending, low-cost pet recovery device using BLE, IR, and Wi-Fi configuration.

My work lies at the intersection of embedded systems, software-defined networking, and humane technology.
