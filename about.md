I’m a DevOps and electronics engineer with over 8 years of experience in infrastructure automation, embedded IoT systems, and cloud platforms. I’m passionate about building humane, accessible technology — especially for animal safety and community impact.

My current focus is developing SDN-inspired infrastructure to scale the LostPet Beacon for shelters and wildlife applications.
